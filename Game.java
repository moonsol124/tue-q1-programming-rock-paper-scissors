 * goal is to use
 * 1. inheritance
 * 2. polymorphism
 * 3. abstract classes / interfaces / subclasses
 * 4. objected oriented programming
 * 5. division of methods
 * 6. lisvoke substitution
 * 
 * idea:
 * 1. game play option with abstract class thus inheritance: rock, paper, scissors
 * 2. game rule checker with interface: rock checker, paper checker, scissor checker
 * 3. decides who wins, by using the rule checkers, thus applying polymorphism and lisvoke substitution
